## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Json-Server server

To start a json server, run:

```bash
npm i -g json-server
json-server --watch db.json
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
